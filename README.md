# Technologies used in Rebar and Universal Relay Boilerplate

For the most up to date list of technologies used please go to [CodeFoundries.com](http://codefoundries.com/developer/rebar/technologies-used.html).

## Client side

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)                                | Library for building Single Page Applications and apps. Often called the 'V' in the MVC model. |
| [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)         | React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy code loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in. Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought. |
| [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)                        | React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. |
| [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) | Router for React Native based on new React Native Navigation API. |
| [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)                                      | A Javascript framework for building data-driven react applications. |
| [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/)                      | Library for implementing [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) in React. All user interface in this kit is built exclusively with Material UI components. |
| [material-ui-country-flags](https://github.com/codefoundries/material-ui-country-flags) | Library with flag icons for Material-UI, used for the language selector. |
| [material-ui-credit-card-icons](https://github.com/codefoundries/material-ui-credit-card-icons) | Library with icons for all major credit cards. |

## Server side

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)                               | Event-driven, non-blocking I/O runtime based on JavaScript that is lightweight and efficient. |
| [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/docs/getting-started/)             | A query language created by Facebook in 2012 for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models for client‐server applications. |
| [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)                 | An graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE. It allows to test the entire schema provided by GraphQL and can be an excellent tool for exploring the boilerplate, as well as a part of applications built on top of it. |
| [Express GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql)   | A Node.js express library that allows the creation of GraphQL servers. |
| [Isomorphic Relay](https://github.com/denvned/isomorphic-relay) | Adds server side rendering support to React Relay. The boilerplate fully utilizes this library. |
| [Data Loader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader)           | Generic utility to be used as part of your application's data fetching layer to provide a consistent API over various backends and reduce requests to those backends via batching and caching. |
| [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)                | The right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. |
| [JWT](https://jwt.io/)                                          | JSON Web Tokens is an industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for representing claims securely between two parties. |
| [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)             | Reusable React component will manage all of your changes to the document head with support for document title, meta, link, script, and base tags. |

## Development tools

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [Flow](http://flowtype.org/)                                    | Static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs. |
| [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)                                    | Pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX. |
| [Babel](http://babeljs.io)                                      | Compiles ES6/ES7 to ES5. Allows using features from ES6 and ES7 today. Also, used by Relay. |
| [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)                             | Bundles npm packages and the application Java Script into a single file. Includes hot reloading via [react-transform-hmr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-transform-hmr). Also, Webpack can bundle any required CSS. |
| [NPM Scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)              | Glues all this together in a handy automated build. |



# Development Setup

For the most up to date setup instructions please go to the [development setup instructions](http://codefoundries.com/developer/rebar/development-setup.html).

## Initial Development Machine Setup

The setup is for OS X only. Prerequisites:

* **Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**.  
* **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
* **Make sure** that Node.js is at least version 6.0 and NPM is at least version 3.
* **In order to speed up NPM** run `npm set progress=false`. This [speeds up NPM significantly](https://twitter.com/gavinjoyce/status/691773956144119808).
* **Install react-native-cli** run `npm install -g react-native-cli`
* **Install yarn** run `npm install -g yarn`


## Initial Project setup on local machine

In order to set up the project locally, perform the following steps:

| Action                    | Notes                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `git clone https://github.com/codefoundries/UniversalRelayBoilerplate` | Clone from github. Alternatively, you can download the source and update in some different way. |
| `yarn` | Install node packages. |
| `yarn setup-local` | Set up default configuration for running the boilerplate. |

In addition to the above, you might want to specify `JWT_SECRET` by modifying the `.env` file. This step can be skipped if you do not care about the actual security and simply want to get the project running.

## Running in development mode

In order to develop, three servers need to be started:

* Web server.
* Webpack server.
* React Native packager.

This can be done with one command:

* Start application HTTP and Webpack server: `yarn dev`.

To open the app:

* Navigate to `http://localhost:4444`, or whatever IP was assigned when running `yarn update-ip` or after installation.

To run the iOS app in the emulator:

* If the IP of your development machine has changed, run `yarn update-ip`.
* Run `react-native run-ios`.


## Configuring Cassandra locally

* Install and configure Cassandra following the steps in [Cassandra Installation on Mac](/developer/cassandra/cassandra-installation-mac.html).
* Update the name of the database and the database server in `/.env`, or use the defaults. The defaults are:

```javascript
CASSANDRA_CONNECTION_POINTS=localhost
CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE=urb
```

* Configure to use Cassandra as default persister: `yarn update-default-persister -- cassandra`.
* Create the database with `yarn setup-database`.

## Configuring Dynamodb locally with Docker

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* Navigate to the docker-compose.yml file `cd units/urb-persister-dynamodb`.
* Then run `docker-compose up` in a new terminal to start up a local dynamo db (or start it via docker Kitematic).
* Configure to use DynamoDB as default persister: `yarn update-default-persister -- dynamodb`.

## Other databases

Instructions for other databases will be added as support for those is added.
